# CSVSorter

A simple CSV sorter that will sort a CSV file by last name, first name and then output the sorted CSV file

## Usage

Run `lib\RunCSVSorter.rb` in ruby to begin CSV file sorting. Tests are located in `spec\CSVSorter_spec.rb` and can be ran with `bundle exec rspec spec\CSVSorter_spec.rb`.

## Notes

Some things can be tightened up and further improved. More test cases can and should be added, change from using a CSV file to using an array as we donâ€™t want to bring reading a CSV file into our sorting test, and clean up and tighten our CSVSorter file.
